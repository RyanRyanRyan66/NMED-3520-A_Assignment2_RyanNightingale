            Time Zones follow lines of longitude, running from north to south, which means they all converge at the poles. If you wanted to walk through all of the time zones in a short amount of time the poles would be the only place to do it. Additionally if you were to stand on the exact location of a pole you could be in all time zones at once (and become the master of time probably). At the north pole 38 time zones converging is not much of a problem because no one lives there. But the south pole is a different story due its several research stations inhabited by scientists. Instead of having 38 time zones inside of your research station the scientists decided to just pick one to follow. They picked New Zealand's time zone because New zealand is the most common route used to access the south pole.

            The fewest time zones a country can have is one and there are several countries with only one. The most surprising entry on this list is China which has only one time zone. This is especially shocking when you consider that China is the third largest country and could have a total of five time zones. Despite China's massive size they opted for only one time zone to strengthen national unity and avoid administrative difficulties. This creates some troubles for the people in western China as things like the work day do not line up very well with the natural day.

            France has the most time zones despite its relatively small size because of its oversea territories. Its total number of time zones is 12.
