            Time zones follow longitude and run north to south, because of this they all converge at the poles. 
            If you wanted to travel through all of the time zones by foot the poles would be the only place to do it, 
            if you were to stand on the exact north or south pole you could be in all time zones at once (and become the master of time probably). 
            At the north pole 38 time zones converging is not much of a problem because no one lives there but the south pole is inhabited by scientists. 
            The solution to this problem was the scientists picking a timezone to follow. 
            They chose New Zealand's time mostly because Antarctica is usually accessed through New zealand.

            The least amount of time zones you can have is one and there are several countries with only one but the most shocking out of this group is china having only one time zone. 
            China is the third largest country and could have a total of five time zones but decided to keep only one to strengthen national unity and avoid administrative difficulties. 
            This creates some troubles for the people in western china as things like the work day do not line up very well with the natural day.

            France has the most time zones despite its relatively small size because of its oversea territories. Its total number of time zones is 12.
