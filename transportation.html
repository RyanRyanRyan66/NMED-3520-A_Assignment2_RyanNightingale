            Throughout the duration of their voyages cruise ships are constantly passing through time zones. To avoid confusion among the passengers the captain of each ship sets their own time for the ship. Because of this you could argue that there are many tiny time zones moving across the globe constantly, which makes the concept of time travel far more confusing and in this case, it becomes more like time migration. Although this system works very well while the ship is at sea, trouble is encountered when the ship docks at a port with its own local time and passengers disembark. This sudden change in time when stepping off the cruise ship onto dry land is not only an incredible way of time travelling but a massive source of confusion and difficulties. Specifically this change in time can lead to confusion about the cruise ship's departure time, and the times for on-shore activities.

    <h3> Aircraft </h3>

            Modern aircraft allow for the ability to “manipulate” time and even “time travel” in several different ways. Depending on your direction of travel, taking an airliner can make day or night seem prolonged or sped up. This can be especially noticeable at sunrise or sunset. The reason for this perceived time manipulation is due to the speed of the aircraft compared to the rotation of the earth. This can be taken to the next level if the aircraft is faster than the rotation of the earth. The earth rotates at about 1600 km/h which means most modern fighter jets, other speed focused military aircraft, and even a single airliner from the 70s are faster than the earth. This supersonic airliner was the Concorde which flew from 1976 to 2003 and carried passengers at speeds up to 2170 km/h. The ability to outrun the sunset and sunrise means that pilots could choose to stay in the day or the night or in the sunset and sunrise if they so choose. Additionally a pilot could choose to experience several sunrises and or sunsets during a flight. Another interesting manipulation of time that aircraft can pull off is the ability to land before you leave. This can be done by crossing over the international date line and landing several hours before you took off (at least as far as the clock knows). With a supersonic jet like the Concorde the international date line is not even required. Any form of travel over the international date line allows for a person to jump between days and even years if you cross it on new years.
