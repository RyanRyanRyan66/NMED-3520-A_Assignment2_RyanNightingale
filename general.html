<h3> Time Zones </h3>
</div>

<div class="paragraph-and-image">
   <div class="just-paragraph">
    <p>
        A time zone is an area which observes a uniform standard time for legal, commercial and social purposes. 
        If we set time zones based on the natural division that comes from the earth's rotation we would have 24 time zones. 
        In reality we have 38 time zones.
         This is because time zones need to account for geographical, political, and historical factors.

<h3> The Prime Meridian </h3>
</div>

<div class="paragraph-and-image">
   <div class="just-paragraph">
    <p>
        The prime meridian is the arbitrarily chosen line for 0 degrees longitude.
        It was placed in Greenwich England during October of 1884 and is essentially the vertical version of the equator. Its function in relation to time zones is that it serves as the reference 
        point which determines the global system of time zones. Greenwich time zone is known as gmt or utc which is why all other time zones display gmt/utc + or - a number (ex; GMT + 1, GMT - 1 ). 
        East of the prime meridian is ahead of Greenwich meaning it will be GMT + _. West of the prime meridian is behind Greenwich meaning it will be GMT - _. 
        Additionally the international date lines location on the globe is determined by greenwich, it is found directly opposite of the prime meridian.

<h3> The International Date Line </h3>
</div>

<div class="paragraph-and-image">
   <div class="just-paragraph">
    <p>
        The international date line is the line that separates two calendar days, it is directly opposite of the prime meridian in greenwich england. 
        Unlike the prime meridian which is a straight line, the international date line zigs and zags all over the place to avoid cutting through countries and island nations. 
        Crossing over to the west side of the line allows you to move forward one day while crossing over to the east allows you to move back one day.
